# Live Sound Engineer

**Hello there! I'm Joost Baaij, a dedicated Live Sound Engineer right here in the heart of Amsterdam.**

With a passion that's as loud as the gigs I work on, I've had the honor of being a part of monumental events like the Italiaans drama at Muziekgebouw and the iconic 76th edition of the Holland Festival. Specializing in systems design and psychoacoustics, I bring unparalleled sound quality that can elevate any event.

If you're looking for a professional touch to ensure your audience is immersed in crystal clear audio, you're in the right place. Let's collaborate and make your next event an auditory masterpiece!
