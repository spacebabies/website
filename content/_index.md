**Hello there!**

I'm Joost Baaij, **Live Sound Engineer 🎵🎤🎹🎷🎸🥁** located in Amsterdam.

With a passion that's as loud as the gigs I work on, I've been part of monumental productions like _Nijntje (Miffy) de musical_ on tour and the _Holland Festival_. I strive to bring unparalleled sound quality that can elevate any event.

- Freelance Live Audio Engineer for Hire
- Strong focus on collaboration and open communication with artists and other technicians
- Extensive experience with Yamaha (Dante) and Midas hardware and software
- Specialized UHF transmitter technician with experience in Shure Axient, ULX-D, and QLX-D
- Good knowledge of ICT and software such as Sound Vision and various DAWs

Handling all aspects of a production, from unloading a trailer to doing a show in QLab, is a given for me. I can work solo on small productions or as part of a crew for larger gigs.

In my work, I am reminded of the importance of listening. Not just as a technical skill but as an art form. Whether through the strings of a quartet or the words of an artist, the ability to listen deeply and translate that into a sound that resonates with others is what makes my role as a sound engineer both challenging and profoundly rewarding.

_In the past, I’ve been full-stack internet developer 🧑‍💻 and owner of a Ruby on Rails studio. 💎_
