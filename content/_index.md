**Hello there!** I'm Joost Baaij, a dedicated Live Sound Engineer ðŸŽ¶ located in Amsterdam.

With a passion that's as loud as the gigs I work on, I've had the honor of being a part of monumental events like _Italiaans Drama_ at Muziekgebouw and the iconic 76th edition of the _Holland Festival_. Specializing in systems design and psychoacoustics, I bring unparalleled sound quality that can elevate any event.

Certified [IAB](https://iabopleidingen.nl/) Live Audio Engineer.

_In the past, Iâ€™ve been full-stack internet developer and owner of a Ruby on Rails studio. ðŸ’Ž_
