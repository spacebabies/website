**Hello there!**

I'm Joost Baaij, a dedicated Live Sound Engineer right here in the east of Amsterdam.

With a passion that's as loud as the gigs I work on, I've had the honor of being a part of monumental events like _Italiaans Drama_ at Muziekgebouw and the iconic 76th edition of the _Holland Festival_. Specializing in systems design and psychoacoustics, I bring unparalleled sound quality that can elevate any event.

If you're looking for a professional touch to ensure your audience is immersed in crystal clear audio, you're in the right place. Let's collaborate and make your next event an auditory masterpiece!

Certified [IAB](https://iabopleidingen.nl/) Live Audio Engineer.
