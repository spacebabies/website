## Okay who is he
Who he is? He is a high-end tea brand sold in The Netherlands.

The owners approached us a while ago, as their sole developer could not longer
make time to work on the website.

## Another tale of legacy
The previous developer was kind enough to prepare us ... yep Rails 3 and ancient
versions of everything! We mapped out a road to get to Rails 5 and after the
approval came, we started executing. The website is now fully managed by us on
up-to-date hardware. We will bump the Rails versions with no rush.

To fix all immediate issues, we deployed a proxy server to act as WAF and single
point of entry, allowing us to install for example https without having to change
a single line of application code. It turned out to be a succesfol approach.

## Building stuff that actually matters
You might think I'm joking around, what with the old Rails version. But truth
be told this is what we love doing. A clear business need; get to work!
