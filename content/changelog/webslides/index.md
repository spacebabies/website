I just discovered [Webslides](https://webslides.tv/). Developer software to
create beautiful slideshows in the form of a normal website. Looks good and

I've already used it on the new website for [Jotocorp](https://www.jotocorp.com).

Intrigued? Head over to [Webslides](https://webslides.tv/) and get going.
