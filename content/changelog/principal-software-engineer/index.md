## Corporate ladder

It relates to the classic career path for software engineers: first you're a developer,
then you're a project lead, and in order to even just keep up eventually you're promoted
to manager, with staff reporting to you, and before long you're not a coder anymore.

Antón's post [My thoughts about the Principal role](https://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2021/20210313-The-principal-role.html) explains it perfectly, and completely resonated with
me. I like building things and I would like to keep my knowledge current. I'm not a
big fan of meetings and I loathe "correcting" underlings because they did not use
the new cover sheet on their TPS reports.
