Foyer Deck 1 at Muziekgebouw is a beast of its own.

It's a space that whispers secrets in echoes, with glass and metal surfaces that love to play ping-pong with sound waves. As I set up for Michel Khalifa's introduction to "Pärt über Bach", I couldn't help but grin at the familiar challenge.

My secret weapon is a monitor speaker aimed straight at the performer. It's like giving them an audio lifeline in a sea of reverb. Without it, poor Michel would be at the mercy of sound bouncing off every surface like a deranged pinball machine. But with it, his soft-spoken wisdom cuts through the noise, clear as a bell.

Speaking of Michel, what a gem of a human being. His knowledge of music is as vast as the North Sea, but he wears it as lightly as a feather. As he began his talk, I watched from my station, always ready to adjust a level or troubleshoot a hiccup.

Then came a moment that'll stick with me. As I cued up a fragment of Pärt's music, Michel closed his eyes. It was like watching someone step into another world. Pärt's notes filled the air, and Michel... well, he seemed to float. It was a reminder of why we do this job - to create these little pockets of magic.

The highlight of the intro was undoubtedly the music video for Amsterdam Sinfonietta. As soon as it started, you could feel the energy in the room shift. The audience leaned in, captivated by the slick black-and-white visuals dancing in perfect sync with Bach's timeless notes. It was pop art meets classical mastery, and boy, did it work.

As the video ended and Michel wrapped up, there was a palpable buzz in the air. The intro had done its job - priming the audience for the sonic journey ahead. And me? I was already mentally preparing for the teardown, feeling that familiar mix of satisfaction and anticipation.

Another day, another sound challenge conquered. In the world of live events, that's what we call a good start.
