On August 29th, I was part of the stage hand team for the _Impact Xperience_ event at Muziekgebouw aan het IJ in Amsterdam. This event marked the festive opening of the new academic year organized by HvA.

My role for the day was fairly specific: I assisted in setting up a ball pit on the terrace of the venue. It's a small yet impactful part of an event designed to explore how we can make a difference in the city, in education, and in society. While my involvement was limited, it was interesting to see how even a small feature like a ball pit could add to the overall atmosphere of the event.

The venue had another surprise for attendees. Moored next to the Muziekgebouw aan het IJ was the Norwegian Prima, a cruise ship designed to elevate every expectation. Even though it was not part of the event, the sight of the ship added an extra layer of excitement to the atmosphere. Known for its most spacious outdoor deck among any new cruise ships and first-rate service, Norwegian Prima stood as an additional symbol of innovation and luxury just a stone's throw away.

It was a day that encapsulated the spirit of innovation, albeit in different formsâ€”from academic discussions to a ball pit on a terrace, and a state-of-the-art cruise ship moored beside the venue. Each component, no matter how large or small, contributed to the overall Xperience.
