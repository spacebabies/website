    title: Karmit Fadael
---
Today, the Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam hosted the unique symphonic blend of the Noord Nederlands Orkest and Fryslân-raised composer Karmit Fadael.

My role began early in the day with the meticulous load-in process, where my team and I worked seamlessly with the orchestra's own skilled crew to arrange accommodations for 73 musicians on stage—a task demanding precision and collaborative spirit. We also accommodated a feed for live broadcast over national classical radio.

### Preparing the Foyer Deck 1

Later in the evening, my focus shifted to Foyer Deck 1, where I was responsible for the audio setup for Thea Derks's pre-concert presentation. Having received audio and video fragments from Derks prior to the event, I ensured these were perfectly queued in QLab. The presentation unfolded without a hitch, thanks to the refined acoustics of the foyer, which I've mastered over time to reduce reverberation, particularly with a strategic dip at 4 kHz, making the space sound spectacular.

### The Main Performance

As the concert commenced, the Muziekgebouw came alive with the premieres of Anders Hillborg's "Mantra – Elegy" and Karmit Fadael's "Mimesis", followed by an innovative rendition of Simeon ten Holt's "Canto Ostinato". The Noord Nederlands Orkest, under the baton of Eivind Gullberg Jensen, delivered a compelling performance, matched in intensity by Pieter van Loenen's impassioned violin.

### Conclusion

The night's collaboration between orchestra, soloist, and crew highlighted the collective effort required to bring such an ambitious project to fruition. Corny as it sounds, I especially appreciated the interactions with Thea and the artists as they left the stage, and wanted/needed someone to talk to. It might not always show from the audience, but these people can be relieved and exuberant when their performance went well. It's a nice vibe to be in.
