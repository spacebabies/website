The performance Wiegeling is an ode to the lullaby. In a soft, sheltered environment, [Sterre Konijn](https://www.sterrekonijn.nl/) (soprano), [Rudi van Hest](https://rudivanhest.nl/) (clarinet), and [Jaber Fayad](https://www.jaberfayad.com/) (oud) engage in musical encounters with the young audience (6-18 months) and with each other.

What makes this concert so special is the often unexpected reaction of the tiny audience: even the most restless or crying babies become utterly mesmerized, watching in wide-eyed wonder. It's a unique spectacle to witness dozens of babies together in such deep awe, reminding one of the profound human spirit already present in such young individuals.

## Behind the Scenes: A World of Softness and Light

As the "eerste inspiciënt" (stage manager), my role for Wiegeling was focused on crafting that perfect, intimate atmosphere. The Kleine Zaal (Small Hall) is transformed into a safe cocoon. We utilize blackout curtains all around, instantly imbuing the space with a sense of security. The artists' lighting rig provides a beautiful foundation, complemented by my colleague Madelief, who designed a lighting plan using our house moving heads to subtly enhance the scene.

The musicians perform this piece acoustically (i.e., without amplification). The Kleine Zaal was recently equipped with a Yamaha AFC Enhance system, an electronic system that can alter the acoustics of the entire room. The artists were impressed with the sound quality, but we ultimately decided to leave the system off. This was to preserve the natural, 'womb-like' sound and the intimate character of the setup. We laid a black ballet floor as a foundation, and the room was richly provided with cushions and rugs to create a soft and inviting environment.

These baby concerts are consistently sold out at Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ, a testament to the demand for such enchanting experiences for the very youngest audiences. Each time, it's a magical afternoon where even the smallest visitors are completely absorbed by the music and sensory stimuli.
