I had the distinct honor of being part of the setup for the _Holland Festival 2023_, marking its remarkable 76th edition. This edition was celebrated for its expansive artistic vision and an impressively diverse and generous audience, more engaged with the festival than ever before.

The festival commenced with the presence of Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrix and opened with the rapturously received performance _Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead_ by Simon McBurney. It concluded with the groundbreaking _Requiem for Nature_ by Tan Dun, Pierre Audi, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The lineup in between showcased a vast array of art forms – from musicals, dance, music, music theatre, theater, exhibitions, to installations and various blends of these. It had everything from avant-garde shows like _Ribingurumu no Metamorufuoshisu_ by Toshiki Okada and Dai Fujikura to highly accessible programs such as _Wuthering Heights_ by Emma Rice. From intimate productions like _Epitaph_ by Ed Atkins to the world premiere of _Indra’s Net_ by the living legend Meredith Monk.

This year’s unmistakable associate artist of the Holland Festival was the singer, composer, and visual artist ANOHNI. She influenced a significant portion of the festival's programming. Through her own works, collaborations, and discussions she introduced, her concerns about feminism, ecological disasters, and the repercussions of colonialism, exploitation, and capitalism resonated deeply. ANOHNI's exceptional ability to connect was evident as she orchestrated unique encounters between international artists and exchanges with public figures, such as the Alderman for Arts and Culture in Amsterdam, Touria Meliani. Additionally, she engaged the audience in new and empathetic ways, exemplified by the Elders project, where respected Dutch individuals, on her initiative, made spontaneous and self-chosen interventions before performances, heightening audience awareness of the moment.

Being a part of such an illustrious event was a testament to the magic and transformative power of arts and culture, and the importance of sound engineering in creating immersive experiences.
