Fourteen speakers, one afternoon, and the delicate dance of fitting headset microphones in Cinema 1 of the Eye Filmmuseum. The European Foodservice Summit brought restaurant leaders from across Europe together for a day of insights into the future of hospitality.

Eye Filmmuseum is always a special venue to work in. Cinema 1, with its 312 seats and excellent acoustics, because of the Alcons ribbon soundsystem, transformed for this occasion from screening room to conference space. The fixed seating arrangement worked perfectly for presentations, but meant that every technical move - from mic checks to video cues - was extra visible to the audience.

Fourteen speakers means fourteen conversations about earrings. "I'm sorry, but the small metal wire from the headset can tap against dangling earrings and we'll hear that through the audio." It's a recurring conversation I try to have as humbly as possible. Sometimes they take them off, sometimes they don't. "I won't move my head," they say, or "I don't care." Both responses are fine - my job is to point out potential downsides, not dictate what they should do.

DPA headsets require a certain intimacy and craftsmanship. Getting close to people, reassuring them, making sure they feel comfortable while simultaneously ensuring perfect audio. It's a skill not all sound engineers possess, but one that's essential for events like this.

Sven and I had a nice flow with the video cues and lighting. The show caller wanted the ident played loud, and it worked. Especially after the break, you could see the audience shake awake as the sound filled the room. We also improvised by bringing the soundtrack back at strategic moments - those moments arise from the energy of the moment, when you feel the audience is ready for it.

The gobos and moving heads gave Cinema 1 a warm, professional look that perfectly matched the high-quality content. It's fascinating how lighting can transform a space from clinical conference room to a place where real connection happens.

The real surprise of the day was Jasper Udink ten Cate as the closer. Where most speakers stayed neatly behind the lectern, Jasper exploded the space with energy. He talked about his art projects - some succeeded, others failed, but that was precisely the point. Most memorable was his story about deconstructing food into basic shapes, which he then formed as ceramic tableware to serve the same food again. Conceptually brilliant, and the way he told it - with such passion and humor - made you understand why he was the perfect finale to a day full of food innovation.

The entire Eye ecosystem contributed to the experience. Participants wandered between other spaces, the iconic architecture did its work, and the venue's professional appearance reinforced the summit's message. Sometimes you almost forget you're working when location, content, and technology come together so perfectly.
