As the last rays of sunlight illuminated H'ART Museum's courtyard, Kevin, Gijs and I stood ready for an extraordinary evening - the opening of _Brancusi, The Birth of Modern Sculpture_.

First, the VIP speech in the Kerkzaal at 18:00. This space presented a challenge - the natural reverb was so pronounced that every intervention required careful consideration. The French Ambassador addressed the invited guests, and every word needed to cut through crystal clear despite the acoustic challenges of this historic space.

At 20:30, we moved to the garden for the grand opening event. Here we had distributed our ten Meyer X20s across three zones: one inside a tent (fortunately, the weather held), a central zone around the stage where Annabelle Birnie, the museum's director, delivered her speech, and a third zone at the garden's edges.

The evening unfolded in layers. After Annabelle's welcome, the jazz trio took over the atmosphere, followed by the DJ who kept the energy flowing until 23:00. Our speaker distribution ensured even sound coverage throughout the entire outdoor space.

Then came the challenge every tech knows well: the load-out in total darkness. One hour to pack ten speakers, LED-pars and uplights, all cabling, and peripherals. In the dark, every movement felt like a dance between memory and instinct. But we got everything - each piece of equipment found its way back to the truck.

Constantin Brancusi would have understood what perfection means in simplicity. That evening, we found our own version: clear audio, seamless transitions, and a load-out completed before the last guest left the museum.
