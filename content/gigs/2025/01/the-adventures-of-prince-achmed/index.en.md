The great thing about producing a live film score, is that they are passion projects almost by definition. Steven Kamperman's rendition of _The Adventures of Prince Achmed_ was no exception.

Being the sound guy for live (silent) film scores has become [somewhat of a niche for me](https://www.spacebabies.nl/gigs/o-taxi-9297-an-auditory-time-travel/). I love the dance between visual storytelling and live music - the way each element breathes life into the other. Tonight's performance of _The Adventures of Prince Achmed_ was pure magic.

Steven Kamperman's score brought Lotte Reiniger's intricate silhouettes to vivid life. His compositions shifted seamlessly between moods and acts, painting rich soundscapes that made the hand-cut figures practically leap off the screen. The music didn't just accompany the film - it became its heartbeat.

Eric Vloeimans' trumpet solos soared during Prince Achmed's most dramatic moments. I caught myself grinning as I worked the Plate Reverb, giving his notes that extra shimmer of space they deserved. The way his sound floated above the ensemble, yet stayed perfectly woven into the narrative... that's the stuff that makes this job worth every second.

My prep work started long before the first note. I spent hours with the Yamaha CL5, mapping out its 15 inputs, three effect returns, five monitors and 8 recording buses. Named every channel, dialed in the low-cut filters, set up the compressors - all the invisible groundwork that lets me focus on the music when it matters. The Portico 5043 compressor and 5033 EQ earned their keep that night, helping craft a sound as enchanting as the visual world they accompanied.

Seven hundred people held their breath as the story unfolded. Their laughter bubbled up at just the right moments, and when the final frame faded to black, they leapt to their feet. That standing ovation wasn't just for the performers - it was for the entire experience, for this beautiful marriage of century-old animation and fresh, vibrant music.
