Today the Muziekgebouw played host to a mesmerizing performance called _O táxi n.º 9297_. It was an orchestral narration that weaved through the silent film of the same name, a masterpiece dating back to 1927.

As all-around sound engineer, my role spanned the breadth of this auditory spectacle, from the load-in and setup on April 2 to ensuring every note and sound effect hit the mark during rehearsals and the live performance.

Connecting around 20 microphones, each one destined to capture the unique timbre of instruments like trumpets, clarinets, bassoons, the velvety touch of marimbas, and a whole universe of percussion, was no small feat. It was a task matched only by the talent of the musicians I had the pleasure to work with.

Their talent was something to behold. As they wielded an eclectic mix of props for foley – the art of creating live sound effects – the musicians truly brought the film to life, crafting an immersive soundscape that transported us all back to the roaring '20s.
