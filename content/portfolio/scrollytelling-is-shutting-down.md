There's honor in delivering great work, even if it's a [website announcing
the shuttering of one of your products](https://www.scrollytelling.com).

Sometimes, the best that can happen is for something to end. It was the case
for Scrollytelling, of which I am a co-founder. A bittersweet goodbye for sure.
We created great unique content, had our delivery apparatus in top condition,
and had a phenomenal reach. Over half the country has seen our work!

So yeah, the new website's occasion is sad, but it does look very pretty.
Where one door closes, another one opens.
