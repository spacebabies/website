My very own father is a renowned expert of ceramic glazes. It's been his work his entire life.

And retirement or not, it seems he has a little trouble letting go...

Joking aside. Anyone who has been tasked with producing a new glaze in the color red, sooner or later ends up chatting with him. He's the authority on this, and always open to sharing recipes, resources, anything.

## Now with 100% more dead trees
All that knowledge is available in book form. Self-published and from what I hear, the first edition is already about to run out. üßê Naturally, I made the website for it. Last week I've completely rehauled it. Gotta keep up. _(Although I think the old one wasn't even responsive.)_

‚ú® [www.thedefiantred.com](https://www.thedefiantred.com) ‚ú®

The new one is, responsive I mean, and it looks darn pretty too. It haz all the latest clouds. HTTP/2, asset optimisation, Stripe Checkout 3.0, https via Let's Encrypt, and the latest and greatest of secure headers.
