[De Digitale Topschool](https://www.dedigitaletopschool.nl) (Dutch) offers challenging content for children in primary education. It relieves pressure on teachers in the basic educational system, since their gifted students are privately mentored by our top-teachers. Our curriculum is created by experts and is constantly kept up-to-date. _De Digitale Topschool_ is an Dutch innovation in the field of primary education.

## Passend Onderwijs
### _Fitting education? Wha?_


All primary schools in The Netherlands are required to offer _passend onderwijs_: a level of education suitable for each individual child. _De Digitale Topschool_ is aimed at cognitively gifted children in the upper classes. The website offers almost two hundred assignments in various fields, such as physics, poetry, art, math, and history. A student logs on, chooses an assignment, and completes it online with the help of a private mentor.

One of these mentors is Marvyn Koning, researcher at LUMC. He created a series of assignments about blood and cancer. A student who chooses one of these assignments, can get matched with Marvym himself. The mentoring is one-on-one. This is a unique concept.

All primary education schools in The Netherlands can subscribe to _De Digitale Topschool_. The system is operated by the non-profit foundation _Stichting De Digitale Topschool_, whose board contains teachers currently working in the field. The whole was created by Theo Capel, child psychologist in Amsterdam.

## Space Babies created it
Space Babies created the website from scratch and works on improving it since launch. We also operate the chat-based helpdesk that is embedded in the website, so that students receive timely response in case they're stuck. Availability and security are of the utmost importance, and studentâ€˜s personal information is regulated by Dutch privacy laws.
