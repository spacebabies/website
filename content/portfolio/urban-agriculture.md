By invitation of the [Lemon Tree Trust](http://lemontreetrust.org), we went to Iraq to find stories around urban agriculture by people who leave or flee their homes due to conflict, violence, persecution or human rights violations.

We came to seek urban farmers of any skill level. We found awe-inspiring stories of people growing crops and lush gardens in the most unlikely of places. These stories will be published as a series of [Scrollytellings](https://www.scrollytelling.io/) in the coming time.
