My customers hire me to reach bigger online goals.
E-commerce runs uninterrupted, incidents are rare,
and I write documentation and tests to keep it that way.
I specialize in creating mission-critical applications, such as global
e-commerce systems, online streaming storytelling, and cutting-edge websites.

I founded Space Babies in 2000 and have used almost every web technology imaginable.
My products routinely handle millions of visitors and are designed to be fast and reliable.
I usually handle monitoring and preemptive maintenance as well.

Last but not least, I am recognised being in the top 5% of global Ruby developers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/235411).
