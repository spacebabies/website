# Content Adaptation Guidelines

## Core Principles for Content Adaptation ("Hertaling")

This document provides guidelines for adapting content between English and Dutch for our website. The goal is not a literal translation, but rather a creative adaptation that preserves the essence, tone, and message while feeling natural in the target language.

### What "Hertaling" Is and Isn't

- **NOT** literal word-for-word translation
- **IS** a creative adaptation that captures the original's essence
- **NOT** completely divergent from the source material
- **IS** using equivalent expressions natural to the target language
- **NOT** bound to identical sentence structure or paragraphing
- **IS** maintaining the overall flow and organization of ideas

## Detailed Guidelines

### 1. Preserve Core Meaning While Being Creative

Capture the essence and meaning of each paragraph, but feel free to:
- Use different vocabulary than the direct translation equivalent
- Restructure sentences to sound more natural in the target language
- Replace idioms with culturally appropriate equivalents

### 2. Maintain Tone and Style

- Preserve the emotional tone (formal, casual, poetic, technical)
- Maintain the author's voice and stylistic elements
- Keep specialized terminology consistent across the adaptation

### 3. Cultural Adaptation

- Adjust cultural references when needed for comprehension
- Consider the cultural context of both source and target audiences
- Adapt metaphors and examples to resonate with the target audience

### 4. Structure and Formatting

- Preserve headers, subheaders, and overall structure
- Maintain all formatting elements (bold, italics, etc.)
- Keep the HTML comment markers (e.g., `<!--more-->`) intact
- Preserve paragraph breaks but feel free to adjust sentence breaks

## Examples of Good Adaptation

These are taken from the 'Harmony in the Load-out' article in the content directory. This content in particular was hand-translated and as such, needs to be the guidepost for future translations.

### Original English:
> As the final applause died down, we moved in. Each one of us knew our part by heart. In a world where efficiency and precision are kings, we were the silent monarchs of the night.

### Poor Adaptation (too literal):
> Toen het laatste applaus wegstierf, kwamen wij in actie. Ieder van ons kende zijn part uit het hoofd. In een wereld waar efficiëntie en precisie koningen zijn, waren wij de stille monarchen van de nacht.

### Good Adaptation (creative but faithful):
> Al bij de laatste restjes applaus stonden we klaar op het zijpodium. Elk van ons wist al precies wat te doen. In een wereld waar efficiëntie en precisie koningen zijn, waren wij de stille monarchen van de nacht.

## Adaptation Checklist

Before submitting adapted content, verify that:

- [ ] The adaptation captures the essence and main points
- [ ] The language feels natural, not translated
- [ ] Cultural references are appropriate for target audience
- [ ] Technical terms are consistently translated
- [ ] The emotional tone matches the original
- [ ] All formatting and structure elements are preserved
- [ ] No content has been accidentally omitted

## Special Considerations

### Technical/Industry Terms
- Theater and performance terms should maintain industry standards
- It is often okay to retain English in the Dutch version (load-out is an acceptable term for _breek_), but never okay to have Dutch in the English version
- When uncertain about a technical term, research the equivalent used in the target language's industry. "Stage left" is "Podium rechts" in Dutch, and vice versa. "Input list" is "priklijst" yet "Stage plot" is "Stageplot". Discover these boundaries and play with them.

### Creative Elements
- Poetry, wordplay, and puns require special attention
- Prioritize preserving the effect over literal meaning

## Bidirectional Adaptation
These guidelines apply equally to:
- English → Dutch adaptations
- Dutch → English adaptations

Remember that the goal is always to create content that feels like it was originally written in the target language while remaining faithful to the source material's meaning and intent.
