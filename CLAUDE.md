# Content Adaptation Guidelines

## Core Principles for Content Adaptation ("Hertaling")

This document provides guidelines for adapting content between English and Dutch for our website. The goal is not a literal translation, but rather a creative adaptation that preserves the essence, tone, and message while feeling natural in the target language. Above all, the adapted text should never feel translated—it should feel native to the target language.

### What "Hertaling" Is and Isn't

- **NOT** literal word-for-word translation
- **IS** a creative adaptation that captures the original's essence
- **NOT** completely divergent from the source material
- **IS** using equivalent expressions natural to the target language
- **NOT** bound to identical sentence structure or paragraphing
- **IS** maintaining the overall flow and organization of ideas

## Detailed Guidelines

### 1. Preserve Core Meaning While Being Creative

Capture the essence and meaning of each paragraph, but feel free to:
- Use different vocabulary than the direct translation equivalent
- Restructure sentences to sound more natural in the target language
- Replace idioms with culturally appropriate equivalents

### 2. Maintain Tone and Style

- Preserve the emotional tone (formal, casual, poetic, technical)
- Maintain the author's voice and stylistic elements
- Keep specialized terminology consistent across the adaptation

### 3. Cultural Adaptation

- Adjust cultural references when needed for comprehension
- Consider the cultural context of both source and target audiences
- Adapt metaphors and examples to resonate with the target audience

### 4. Structure and Formatting

- Preserve headers, subheaders, and overall structure
- Maintain all formatting elements (bold, italics, etc.)
- Keep the HTML comment markers (e.g., `<!--more-->`) intact
- Preserve paragraph breaks but feel free to adjust sentence breaks

## Canonical Example

The 'Harmony in the Load-out' article, found in the `content` directory, has been carefully translated by hand and represents a "perfect" adaptation. Its concept, jargon, and tone serves as guidepost for future translations. However, it is also important to be creative and bold if the situation calls for it.

## Examples of Good Adaptation

This excerpt is taken from the canonical article:

### Original English:
> As the final applause died down, we moved in. Each one of us knew our part by heart. In a world where efficiency and precision are kings, we were the silent monarchs of the night.

### Poor Adaptation (too literal):
> Toen het laatste applaus wegstierf, kwamen wij in actie. Ieder van ons kende zijn part uit het hoofd. In een wereld waar efficiëntie en precisie koningen zijn, waren wij de stille monarchen van de nacht.

### Good Adaptation (creative but faithful):
> Al bij de laatste restjes applaus stonden we klaar op het zijpodium. Elk van ons wist al precies wat te doen. In een wereld waar efficiëntie en precisie koningen zijn, waren wij de stille monarchen van de nacht.

The following is taken from the sidebar. Note that for Dutch, the exclamation point is replaced by a regular period, since Dutch culture does not appreciate baseless optimism.

### Original English:

If you're looking for a professional touch to ensure your audience is immersed in crystal clear audio, you're in the right place. Let's collaborate and make your next event an auditory masterpiece!

### Poor Adaptation (too literal/academic):

Als je op zoek bent naar een professionele aanpak om ervoor te zorgen dat je publiek ondergedompeld wordt in kristalhelder audio, ben je op de juiste plaats. Laten we samenwerken om van je volgende evenement een auditief meesterwerk te maken!

### Good Adaptation (natural and appropriate):

Op zoek naar een vakkundige aanpak die je publiek onderdompelt in glashelder geluid? Dan ben je hier aan het juiste adres. Laten we samenwerken om van jouw volgende evenement iets onvergetelijks te maken.

## Language Considerations
### Watch for These Common Pitfalls

* **Avoid overly academic language** when simpler alternatives exist
    * Example: "auditief" → "geluid" or "klank" when speaking to general audiences
    * Example: "visueel" → "beeld" when appropriate
* **Be wary of pretentious-sounding terms**
    * Example: "meesterwerk" can sound pretentious in Dutch; consider "onvergetelijke ervaring" or similar alternatives
* **Reduce exclamation marks** for a more professional tone
    * Dutch professional communication often uses fewer exclamation marks than English
* **Generalize rather than translate literally** when describing quality or impact
    * Instead of directly translating "auditory masterpiece" → "auditief meesterwerk"
    * Consider "iets onvergetelijks" or "bijzondere geluidservaring"

## Adaptation Checklist

Before submitting adapted content, verify that:

- [ ] Telltale AI text is strictly avoided ("Naturally!", "I'd be happy to..", etc )
- [ ] The adaptation captures the essence and main points
- [ ] The language feels natural, not translated
- [ ] Cultural references are appropriate for target audience
- [ ] Technical terms are consistently translated
- [ ] The emotional tone matches the original
- [ ] All formatting and structure elements are preserved
- [ ] Overly academic or pretentious language has been avoided
- [ ] No content has been accidentally omitted

## Special Considerations

### Technical/Industry Terms
- Theater and performance terms should maintain industry standards
- It is often okay to retain English in the Dutch version (load-out is an acceptable term for _breek_), but never okay to have Dutch in the English version
- When uncertain about a technical term, research the equivalent used in the target language's industry. "Stage left" is "Podium rechts" in Dutch, and vice versa. "Input list" is "priklijst" yet "Stage plot" is also "Stageplot". Discover these boundaries and play with them.

### Creative Elements
- Poetry, wordplay, and puns require special attention
- Prioritize preserving the effect over literal meaning

## Bidirectional Adaptation
These guidelines apply equally to:
- English → Dutch adaptations
- Dutch → English adaptations

Remember that the goal is always to create content that feels like it was originally written in the target language while remaining faithful to the source material's meaning and intent.
