  title: "About Me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My customers hire me to reach bigger online goals.
    E-commerce runs uninterrupted, incidents are rare,
    and I write documentation and tests to keep it that way.
    I specialize in creating mission-critical applications, such as global
    e-commerce systems, online streaming storytelling, and cutting-edge websites.
    </p>
    <p>
    I founded Space Babies in 2000 and have used almost every web technology imaginable. 
    My products routinely handle millions of visitors and are designed to be fast and reliable.
    I usually handle monitoring and preemptive maintenance as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Last but not least, I am recognised being in the top 5% of global Ruby developers on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/235411">StackOverflow</a>.
