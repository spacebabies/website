  title: "About Me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My customers thrive online, because of their online properties
    I helped create. E-commerce runs uninterrupted, incidents are rare,
    and I write documentation and tests to keep it that way.
    I specialize in mission-critical applications, such as global
    e-commerce and content management systems used from all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    I founded Space Babies in 2000 and have used almost every web technology imaginable. 
    My products routinely handle millions of visitors without breaking a sweat.
    I usually handle monitoring and preemtive maintenance as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Last but not least, I am recognised being in the top 5% of global Ruby developers on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/235411">StackOverflow</a>.
